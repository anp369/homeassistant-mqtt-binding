    - availability topic
    - discovery
    - setting base settings

    when setting `send_only` to True no subscriptions are made, and the device is configured to just
    send values to the broker, which makes it useable for small sensors, that just report values to the broker
    but not actually receive any commands

        disable all parts that subscribe to topics etc.

        :class:`~ha_mqtt.mqtt_device_base.MqttDeviceSettings` for additional info

    .. note::
       this is the base class all other devices inherit from.

       make sure that unique_id is really **really** unique, as it is used by the
       homeassistant internals to differentiate between the devices. Some strange things may happen
       if IDs aren't unique. One possibility would be using uuid.uuid4() or pulling them
